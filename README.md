A Task Dispatcher for Teams

Talk to eachother. Asymetrically. Cuz sometimes different roles require different access. Utilizes two clients. One client has access to the all team members as well as being able to manage the team board. All other team members use the agent client to manage their own individual roles in respect to the total team objectives.

Good for social games too.

## Built
with Socket.io Angular and Express.
